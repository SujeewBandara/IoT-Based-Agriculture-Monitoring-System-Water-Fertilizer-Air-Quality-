# IoT-Based-Agriculture-Monitoring-System-Water-Fertilizer-Air-Quality-
This project is a modular smart agriculture monitoring system designed using an Arduino board as the master and custom ESP32-based slave nodes. It monitors soil moisture, air quality, temperature, and NPK levels, displaying real-time values on an onboard display and logging data to the cloud. The system uses the RS485 protocol for reliable long-distance communication, especially for NPK sensor integration.
RS485 Communication Protocol:
Gained a comprehensive understanding of the RS485 protocol and its practical advantages for long-distance, noise-resistant communication. Also explored its limitations, such as difficulty interfacing directly with typical analog sensors, which influenced our modular design.

Circuit Design and Troubleshooting:
Through building the Smart Agriculture Monitoring System, I improved my skills in schematic design, component selection, and circuit debugging. Tools like Fritzing were used to develop and document the circuit schematics clearly and effectively.
